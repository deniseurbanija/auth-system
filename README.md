# Authentication System üîê

## About
A robust backend application built with Express.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB that implements secure user authentication and post management. The system utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for maintaining secure sessions and provides a RESTful API for user and post operations.

## Features
- üîí Secure user authentication using JWT
- üìù Post creation and management for authenticated users
- üèóÔ∏è Scalable and modular project structure
- üîç Input validation and error handling
- üöÄ Built with modern technologies:
  - Express.js for API development
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - MongoDB for data persistence
  - Docker for containerization
  - AWS ECS for deployment

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- AWS CLI (optional, for deployment)
